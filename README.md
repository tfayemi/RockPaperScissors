# Rock, Python, Scissors

This is a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors game written as a demonstration for my elementary school Python programming students. Don’t mind the pun. They loved it. 

How This Program Works

The computer selects a position at random. The runner will then be prompted to enter a value of “Rock”, “Paper”, or “Scissors”. The program compares the computer’s selection to the user’s input and prints out a statement to the console indicating wether the user has won or lost. 

Of course, there are way better ways to run a game like this, but for a group of elementary school students, this is a great way to illustrate if statements, variables and conditionals!
